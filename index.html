          <h2>About Me</h2>
          
          <p>Former college athlete with two master’s degrees—still figuring out what I want to be when I grow up.</p>
      
          <p>I studied student-athlete identity foreclosure—how athletes struggle to explore careers beyond sports—only to fall into that trap myself. After five years coaching college wrestling and earning an MBA at UTC, I assumed I’d be set for a business career. Turns out, experience matters more than degrees.</p>
      
          <p>That hit me when I started job hunting and realized my résumé was all wrestling, no business. But my MBA capstone—a competitive business simulation—showed me what I loved: strategy, analytics, and decision-making. I stepped up as CEO (mostly because no one else wanted to), made mistakes, learned fast, and led our team to dominate four of five market segments. That was my lightbulb moment.</p>
      
          <p>Now, I’m building that experience. At LEO Events, I work at the intersection of event technology, digital strategy, and analytics—solving problems, optimizing experiences, and making sense of complex data. Outside of work, I’m diving into finance, strategy, analytics, and web development—figuring out what sticks.</p>
      
          <p>Whatever I do, it needs to be:</p>
          
          <ul>
              <li>Challenging</li>
              <li>Strategic</li>
              <li>Problem-Solving</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p>Still figuring it out. Open to ideas. Let’s talk...</p>
