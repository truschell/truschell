        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m a former college athlete with two master’s degrees, still figuring out what I want to be when I grow up. Ironically, I studied student-athlete identity foreclosure (how athletes struggle to explore careers beyond sports) only to fall into that trap myself.</p>
        
        <p>After graduating from Wisconsin, I doubled down on my athletic identity and coached college wrestling for five years. I wanted to make an impact and help athletes develop beyond their sport, but as a coach, my job was to keep them locked in. Kind of a conflict of interest if you think about it. While at UTC, I also took advantage of a tuition waiver and earned an MBA. I figured more education couldn’t hurt.</p>
        
        <p>That decision led me to my capstone course—Strategic Management with Dr. Frank Butler—where everything clicked. We competed in a business simulation, running a company that sold carbon fiber bikes. I stepped up as CEO (mainly because no one else wanted the job), made plenty of mistakes, learned fast, and by the end, our team dominated nearly every major metric. That’s when I realized what drives me: strategy, competition, and solving complex problems.</p>
        
        <p>So, I stepped away from coaching to get a “real” job. With two master’s degrees, I assumed I’d be in high demand. Turns out, experience matters. My resume was all wrestling, no business.</p>
        
        <p>Fortunately, I was able to land a role at LEO Events, where I work at the intersection of event technology, digital strategy, and analytics. I help solve complex problems, optimize processes, and make sense of messy data to improve event experiences. It’s fast-paced, always evolving, and demands creative problem-solving. That's exactly the kind of challenge I thrive on.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of work, I’m diving into finance, strategy, sports, and web development—figuring out what sticks.</p>
    
        <p>What drives me hasn't changed. I thrive when I'm:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing a strategy</li>
            <li>Solving complex problems</li>
            <li>Competing to win</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Still figuring it out. Open to ideas. Let's talk!</p>
