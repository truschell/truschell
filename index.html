        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I‚Äôm a former college athlete with two master‚Äôs degrees, still figuring out what I want to be when I grow up. Ironically, I studied student-athlete identity foreclosure, which is how athletes struggle to explore life beyond sports, only to fall into that exact trap myself.</p>
        
        <p>After graduating from Wisconsin, I doubled down on my athletic identity and coached college wrestling for five years. I wanted to make an impact and help athletes develop beyond their sport, but as a coach, my job was to keep them locked in. Kind of a conflict of interest if you think about it. While at UTC, I also took advantage of a tuition waiver and earned an MBA. More education couldn't hurt, right?</p>
        
        <p>That decision led me to my capstone course‚ÄîStrategic Management with Dr. Frank Butler‚Äîwhere everything clicked. We competed in a business simulation, running a company that sold carbon fiber bikes. I volunteered for the CEO role, unsure what I was getting into, but ready to learn. We made plenty of mistakes and learned a lot, but ultimately, our team dominated every major performance metric. That‚Äôs when I realized what drives me: developing and executing strategies, sovling complex problems, and competing to win‚Äîthe same reasons I love my sport.</p>
        
        <p>So, after some difficult discussions with friends and family, I decided to step away from coaching and explore a new career path. It wasn‚Äôt just a career shift. It meant stepping away from the sport I‚Äôd dedicated my life to. That wasn‚Äôt easy... But with two master‚Äôs degrees, I assumed I‚Äôd be in high demand. Turns out, experience matters. My resume was all wrestling, no business.</p>
        
        <p>Fortunately, I was able to land a role at LEO Events, where I work at the intersection of event technology, digital strategy, and analytics. I help solve complex problems, optimize processes, and make sense of messy data. It‚Äôs fast-paced, always evolving, and requires the same competitive mindset and strategic thinking I‚Äôve relied on my whole life.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of work, I‚Äôm diving into finance, strategy, sports, and web development‚Äîfiguring out what sticks.</p>
    
        <p>At my core, I'm driven by three things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strategy</li>
            <li>Problem Solving</li>
            <li>Competition</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Still figuring it out, but always looking to learn. Let's connect!</p>
